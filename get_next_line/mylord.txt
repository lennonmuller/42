Long, long ago there lived, in Japan a
brave warrior known to all as Tawara Toda,
or “My Lord Bag of Rice.” His true name
was Fujiwara Hidesato, and there is a
very interesting story of how he came
to change his name.
One day he sallied forth in
search of adventures, for he had
the nature of a warrior and could
not bear to be idle. So he buckled on his
two swords, took his huge bow, much taller than himself, in his hand, and slinging
his quiver on his back started out. He had
not gone far when he came to the bridge
of Seta-no-Karashi spanning one end of
the beautiful Lake Biwa. No sooner had he
set foot on the bridge than he saw lying
right across his path a huge serpent-dragon. Its body was so big that it looked like
the trunk of a large pine tree and it took
up the whole width of the bridge. One of
its huge claws rested on the parapet of one
side of the bridge, while its tail lay right
against the other. The monster seemed
to be asleep, and as it breathed, fire and
smoke came out of its nostrils.
